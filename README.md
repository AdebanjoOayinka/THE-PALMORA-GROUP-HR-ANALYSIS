# THE-PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS
This shows the steps I used in carrying out the Palmora HR Analysis using Excel and presenting the results in Power BI.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Palmora Group, is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.

Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmora, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. 

This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards, revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues. 

The CEO of Palmora, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they get out of hand. 

The CHRO, Mr Yunus Shofoluwe, has been assigned the task to identify key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately.

The MD has decided to recruit me as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention.

The future of gender equality in Palmora lies in the analysis of this data.

## PROJECT INSTRUCTION

      ● Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmora management team would need to address.
     
      ● Analysis should be visualised using appropriate charts.
     
      ● The focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its regions.
     
      ● The insights required are based on your discretion.

## PROJECT INSIGHT

    ● Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender.
    
    ● To assign a generic gender status to these employees.
    
    ● Some employees are without a salary because they are no longer with the company. You will need to take those employees out.
    
    ● Lastly, some departments are indicated as “NULL”. These departments would also need to be taken out.

## PROJECT FOCUS
    1. What is the gender distribution in the organization?
    
    2. What is the gender distribution regions?
    
    3. What is the gender distribution regions and departments?
    
    4. Show insights on ratings based on gender?
    
    5. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management.
    
    6. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
    
        ● To show if Palmora meets this requirement?
        
        ● To show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000?
        
        ● How many employees fall into a different salary bands?
        
        ● Also to visualize this by regions?

## FURTHER ANALYSIS

    5. Mr Gamma said since I am already working on the employee data, I could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. 
    
He handed me another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to:
    
       ● Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees.
            
       ● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus).
            
       ● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.
            
## Data Set Description

The data set provided contains two sets of information, one set of data for the gender and another for the bonus percentage.

## Data Source

    ● Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://microsoft-excel.en.download.it/download)
         
## Data Analysis using MS Excel

    ● MS Excel Tables for data sorting, manipulating, cleaning and formatting
   
## Data Cleaning and Presentation using PowerBI

    ● Microsoft PowerBI [Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
   
    ● Powerquery was used structure the data futher and make it usaeabe in the PowerBI envonment and then the charts were created.
     
## EXPOSITORY DATA ANALYSIS
The two sheets received from the HR department were combined to one sheet for the presentation in PowerBI.

Interactive charts were created using the different build types;

Note: Individual colour codes was maintained in this report to show the gender types.

  1. To display the gender distribution in the organization, gender distribution regions and in departments:

         ● A pie chart and Bar charts were used to show gender distributions.
    
  2. A Bar Chart was used to show the insights on ratings based on gender side by side.
        
  3. A Bar chart was used show gender company’s salary structure for each region.
     
     - This clearly shows there is a gender pay gap in one of the regions. This is where the management should focus on to           rectify the pay gap.

  5. A Bar chart was used to show the total salary payment for each gender distribution in each department.
     
  6. A Bar chart was used to show the minimum salary for each to show if the regulation adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000.

      ● Does Palmora meet this requirement: The data shows the company does not meet the requirement of $90,000 minimum salary.

  7. A Table with filter function was used to show the the pay distribution of employees grouped by different salary bands for each region.

## ANALYSIS FOR BONUS PAYOUTS
   
  1. A table build was used to show the amount to be paid as bonus to individual employees. Also displayed using a card build function.
        
  2. A table build was used to show the total amount (Bonus + Salary) to be paid to individual employees. Also this displayed using a card build function.
  
  3. The total amount to be paid out per region was displayed using a pie chart.

            2. There were some names of staff that appeared in two locations;
            
                 a. With different rating
